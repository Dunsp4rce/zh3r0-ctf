Subset of subset of hacking machines challenges

# Challenge
## Flag 4
We are given a URL - ``` hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

# Solution

> Optional: Find IP address of the given domain using **ping**

Since it is a machine, begin with a full port scan

``` nmap -T4 -sC -sV -p- hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

> Note: Not sure if I used the right [options], run ``` nmap --help ``` for better understanding and optimisation

This reveals all the open ports and services running on each port. Also notice that the services running are all mixed up.

```
22/tcp    open     http
25/tcp    filtered smtp
99/tcp    open     ssh
324/tcp   open     ftp
4994/tcp  open     unknown
11211/tcp filtered memcache
```

* ``` FTP port 324 ``` allowed **anonymous** login
	* Use ``` ftp hackit.zh3r0.ml 324 ``` to connect
	* Login with the following credentials
	```
	user      : anonymous
	password  :
	```
	* Go into ``` PASSIVE mode ``` using command ``` pass ```
	* Use ``` ls -la, cd, get ``` to enumerate the hidden files, hidden directories and receives the files onto your machine
	* File ``` .stayhidden ``` contains an **Employee ID**, connect to port ``` 4994 ``` and use this **Employee ID** to obtain **Flag 4**
	``` nc 139.59.3.42 4994 ```
	``` Flag 4: zh3r0{y0ur_s4l4ry_wa5_cr3dit3d} ```
