Subset of subset of hacking machines challenges

# Challenge
## Flag 5
We are given a URL - ``` hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

# Solution

> Optional: Find IP address of the given domain using **ping**

Since it is a machine, begin with a full port scan

``` nmap -T4 -sC -sV -p- hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

> Note: Not sure if I used the right [options], run ``` nmap --help ``` for better understanding and optimisation

This reveals all the open ports and services running on each port. Also notice that the services running are all mixed up.

```
22/tcp    open     http
25/tcp    filtered smtp
99/tcp    open     ssh
324/tcp   open     ftp
4994/tcp  open     unknown
11211/tcp filtered memcache
```

* Since ``` http ``` is running on port ``` 22 ```, it will be restricted by the browser and we will not be able to access it directly. There are two ways around this problem.
	1. Allow restricted ports in Firefox Browser
		* Go to ``` about:config ``` in Firefox address bar
		* Add a new string with name and value as 
		```
		name  : network.security.ports.banned.override
		value : 22 
		```
		* Access ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/ ``` to get **Flag 5**<br/>
