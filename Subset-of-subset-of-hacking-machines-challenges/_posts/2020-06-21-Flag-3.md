Subset of subset of hacking machines challenges

# Challenge
## Flag 3
We are given a URL - ``` hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

# Solution

> Optional: Find IP address of the given domain using **ping**

Since it is a machine, begin with a full port scan

``` nmap -T4 -sC -sV -p- hackit.zh3r0.ml ```

> Note: Not sure if I used the right [options], run ``` nmap --help ``` for better understanding and optimisation

This reveals all the open ports and services running on each port. Also notice that the services running are all mixed up.

```
22/tcp    open     http
25/tcp    filtered smtp
99/tcp    open     ssh
324/tcp   open     ftp
4994/tcp  open     unknown
11211/tcp filtered memcache
```

* Since ``` http ``` is running on port ``` 22 ```, it will be restricted by the browser and we will not be able to access it directly. There are two ways around this problem.
	1. Allow restricted ports in Firefox Browser
		* Go to ``` about:config ``` in Firefox address bar
		* Add a string with name and value as
		```
		name  : network.security.ports.banned.override
		value : 22
		```
		* Access ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
	2. Access the webpage through cURL or wget<br/>
	``` curl http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
	``` wget http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/robots.txt ```
* We get a string encoded in **Base58** (know your bases :wink:) along with a hint for another flag (something to do with ads)
* Use https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ to decode the string to get another webpage ``` /clue3349203.txt ```
* Visit ``` http://hackit.zh3r0.ml:22/clue3349203.txt ``` to see a **JSFuck code**
* Use http://codertab.com/JsUnFuck to decode the **JSFuck code** to get an **Employee ID**
* Connect with ``` port 4994 ``` and enter the **Employee ID** to get **Flag 3**<br/>
``` nc 139.59.3.42 4994 ```<br/>
``` Flag 3: zh3r0{y0ur_b0nu5_i5_p4id} ```
