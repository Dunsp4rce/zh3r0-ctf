## Question

my cat found a Portable Video Device help him to find the flag

## Solution

We were given a zip file which contained a cat image and an embedlog.log file.

Looking at the question, it was suspicious to see P, V, D capitalised, hence googling '**PVD CTF**' led us into a unique
steganography technique called as Pixel Value Differencing. It also led us to this github page https://github.com/TonyJosi97/PVD-Steganography
which has a similar embedlog.log file. Using the script given in the Github page, I was able to decrypt the image and get our flag.
